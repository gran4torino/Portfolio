Alexey Kuzmin TEACHER November 21, 2021 21:53 Good afternoon!

Google Sheets: Plot a bar chart of users by age 10

Construct 2 graphs showing the distribution of people by profession depending on their gender 10

Plot the number of films by genre 10

Plot the number of films by year 10

Graph the number of ratings by month and year (convert timestamp to date see stackoverflow.com...gle-sheets) 10

Reveal the top 5 most active users (most ratings) in the last 3 months 10

### Total - 60 points out of 60

Python Upload ratings and movies files to colab and create pandas dataframes from them

Using Pandas, using dataframe ratings, find the id of the user who gave the most ratings 10

Leave in the ratings dataframe only those films that this user has rated 10

Add 3 columns to the dataframe from the job:

By genre. Each column is a genre. We write down one if the film belongs to this genre and 0 - if not, columns with the total number of ratings from all users for the film and the total rating from all users 10

Form X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test 10

Take a linear regression model (or any other for a regression problem) and train it on movies 5 <- RandomForestClassifier is a classification model, not a regression model 
### (disagree!!! it's a classification and regression model!!!)

Evaluate the quality of the model on X_test, y_test using metrics for the regression problem 0 <- score in this case is accuracy (may be a classification model), not R2

Upload data to spark 10

By means of spark, display the average rating for each movie 20

Calculate the average rating for each genre using spark 20

In a spark, get 2 dataframes with the 5 most popular and most unpopular films (by the number of ratings, or by the rating itself - your choice) 20

### Total - 125 points out of 140

For the theoretical part: Describe the main business reports (2-3 pieces) that we want to see for our business 10

Describe the main data available and sources of data 20

Describe the main entities in the data warehouse (star schema) and the process of pouring data 20

Describe the main data quality checks (10 pieces) that we will use when uploading 10

Come up with a Data project that should improve your business performance and paint it according to Crisp-DM 20

Describe required roles in the data team in steps 4 and 5 30

### FINAL ASSESSMENT - Pass
