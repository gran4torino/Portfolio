5 <- RandomForestClassifier is a classification model, not a regression model
Evaluate model quality on X_test, y_test using metrics for regression task
0 <- score in this case is accuracy (may be a classification model), not R2
Upload data to spark
10
By means of spark, display the average rating for each movie
20
Calculate the average rating for each genre using spark
