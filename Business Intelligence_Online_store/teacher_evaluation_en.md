Good afternoon, Victor!

Many thanks for the work done on the final task!

You managed to analyze the dataset from the training example and build a concise and informative dashboard.
The dashboard turned out to be easy to use, logically structured, each block is not overloaded with visualization elements.
Before building the report, you assessed the quality and completeness of the source data, identified inaccuracies and anomalies, recorded the results of familiarization with the data and identified limitations.
After understanding the data, you have identified potential problems that can be solved using the dataset, and set about finding solutions to such problems in the data.
Although the initial data was incomplete and not of very high quality, you were able to extract the most information useful for business from them!
After getting acquainted with the data, you determined the circle of stakeholders and their business interests, which allowed you to create a list of metrics and options for their visualization on the dashboard.
Based on the results of the analysis and construction of the dashboard, we made conclusions about the current factors in the development of the store.

I note - a thorough approach to research and a concise dashboard!

You've got a great report! Off!

If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them in private messages on Slack.

Good luck with your further studies!
