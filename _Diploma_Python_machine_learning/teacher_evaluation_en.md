Teacher's comment

Good afternoon.

Thank you for your work.
You qualitatively described the variables, built and described the correlation matrix.
The statistics are also correct.
The work is neatly designed, the conclusion according to the hypothesis is correct.

It's great that they made a boxing raft in terms of salary and evaluated the distributions.
All iterations associated with training and validation of the model are correct. The quality is acceptable for this work!

Offset!
